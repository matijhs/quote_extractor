– The origin of the phrase “a picture is worth a thousand words” is unknown but is often assigned to Napoléon Bonaparte who said “Un bon croquis vaut mieux qu'un long discours,” (a good sketch is better than a long speech). But then again in Printers' Ink is marked that “a famous Japanese philosopher [said]: 'One Look is Worth a Thousand Words,' and he was right – nearly everyone likes to "read" pictures.” In my case, however, I like to follow more the spoofed version by John McCarthy who said: “As the Chinese say, 1001 words is worth more than a picture.” I focus on the written word and want to know what people are saying.
